              This website-hosted user interface (this “Interface”) is an open source frontend software portal to the staccattac.fun protocol, a
              decentralized and community-driven collection of blockchain-enabled smart contracts and tools (the “staccattac.fun Protocol”). This
              Interface and the staccattac.fun Protocol are made available by the staccattac.fun Foundation, however all transactions conducted on
              the protocol are run by related permissionless smart contracts. As the Interface is open-sourced and the staccattac.fun Protocol and
              its related smart contracts are accessible by any user, entity or third party, there are a number of third party web and
              mobile user-interfaces that allow for interaction with the staccattac.fun Protocol.
